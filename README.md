# Complexity and recursion: Attribution

## **1. About this project**

This problem is an **assignment problem**.  
We will therefore use **recursivity** to solve it. Also, the objective is to **optimize the code** by finding the number of exact solutions as fast as possible and thus **reducing the complexity**.

The number of students and subjects **varies according to our data** which are contained in the csv files in the *'data'* folder.

For each case, each student has the right to **formulate 4 wishes in decreasing order of preference** for the assignment.  
Thus, wish 1 will have a value of *8*, wish 2 a weight of *4*, the 3rd one of *2* and finally the last one will only count for *1*. Several students belonging to the same assignment constitute a **team**.

Please note that there are **2 main constraints**:
  1. A student can only belong to one team
  2. A team is made up of a maximum of 3 students

It is therefore the **sum of the wishes** (and therefore their weight) that must be **optimized**.

The solutions we find are indicated in the file **CR_Attribution**. We find there :
  - The number of students
  - The number of missions
  - The optimized sum
  - The execution time to find the solution

This project was done in a school context with another classmate.
